title: "Billing for Residential Proxies"
description: "Residential proxies work on a one-time payment model.   When you purchase a package, you receive a set amount of bandwidth (measured in gigabytes).  "

## How Billing Works

Every request you send through a Residential proxy consumes bandwidth.  Bandwidth is deducted **per byte of traffic** — both download and upload count.  \
Once your bandwidth is used up, the plan expires, and you’ll need to purchase a new package.

## Checking Usage

In the **Dashboard → Residential**, you’ll always see:

- Remaining GB
- GB already consumed
- Percentage used

This makes it easy to know when to top up.

## Example

If you purchase a **10 GB package** and scrape a website that loads 1 MB per page:

- Each page consumes ~1 MB of your plan.
- 10 GB = ~10,000 pages loaded.

<Tip>
  For recurring projects where you know your traffic volume, consider buying larger Residential packages to reduce interruptions, contact us for that.
