title: "Residential Proxies"
description: "Residential proxies are IP addresses sourced from real consumer devices connected through ISPs.  "

Because they look just like normal users, websites treat them with a higher level of trust compared to datacenter IPs.

They are the **most versatile type of proxy** we offer, perfect for tasks such as:

- Web scraping & crawling
- Ad verification
- Social media automation
- Market research & competitor tracking
- SEO monitoring

## How They Differ from Static Proxies

- **Residential Proxies** → One-time bandwidth packages. You generate them dynamically from the Dashboard.
- **ISP/Datacenter Proxies** → Subscription-based, static IPs automatically delivered after purchase.

  <Info>
    This distinction is crucial: with Residential, you’re paying for **traffic used (GB)**, while ISP/Datacenter are billed on a **monthly subscription basis**.
