  <Accordion title="Proxies not generating" icon="sparkles">
    - Ensure your plan still has bandwidth.
    - Verify you selected a country and entered a quantity.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bandwidth depleting too quickly" icon="sparkles">
    - Some tools retry failed requests aggressively. Limit retries or add delays.
    - Optimize your requests to avoid downloading unnecessary data.
    - Never share your proxies with anyone
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Connection slow or unstable" icon="sparkles">
    - Try a different country for better routing.
    - Rotate proxies if you’re seeing temporary blocks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Proxy not working in a browser" icon="sparkles">
    - Check if the proxy protocol matches your browser configuration (HTTP vs SOCKS5).
    - Some browsers require `user:pass@ip:port` format — confirm you’re using the supported one.
    - Try with a simple tool like `curl` first to confirm the proxy itself works.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Target website still blocking" icon="sparkles">
    - Some sites use aggressive anti-bot protection. Try rotating proxies more often.
    - Add **delays between requests** to mimic human browsing.
    - Change your user-agent or use browser automation instead of raw HTTP requests.
    - If a specific site is critical, consider upgrading to **ISP or Datacenter proxies** for static IP reliability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Downloads not starting / proxies exporting empty file" icon="sparkles">
    - Ensure you generated at least one proxy before clicking **Download**.
    - Some browsers block automatic `.txt` downloads; check your browser’s downloads folder or settings.
    - Use the **Copy** button as an alternative if downloads are restricted.
