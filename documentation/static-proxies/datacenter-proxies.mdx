They are fast, stable, and low-latency, making them ideal for use cases that require speed and volume rather than stealth.

## Why Datacenter Proxies?

Unlike Residential proxies, which are sourced from real devices, Datacenter proxies are generated from dedicated server infrastructures.  

They provide:

- **High speed and low latency,** best for bulk automation and real-time tasks.  
- **Reliability**, with stable connections across long sessions.  
- **Scalability**, making it easier to manage large numbers of concurrent requests.  

## How Datacenter Plans Work

Datacenter proxies are sold as a monthly subscription plan.  Once you purchase a package, your proxies are delivered automatically in the Dashboard under **Datacenter Proxies**.  

You do not need to generate them like Residential proxies. Instead:  

- Your proxies appear immediately after payment.  
- You can download them as a `.txt` file or copy them to your clipboard.  
- They remain active for as long as your subscription is valid.  

At the end of the billing period, you can renew or upgrade your subscription to continue using them.

## Using the Dashboard

1. After purchase, go to **Dashboard → Generation → ISP & Datacenter **.  

2. Your active proxies will already be listed — no setup required.  

3. Use the **Copy** or **Download** buttons to export them.  

<Note>
  The proxies are static and dedicated to you, so the list will not change unless you adjust or renew your subscription.
