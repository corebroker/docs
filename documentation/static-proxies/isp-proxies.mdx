title: "ISP (Static Residential) Proxies"
description: "ISP proxies, also known as Static Residential proxies, are IP addresses provided by real Internet Service Providers but hosted in data centers.  "
---

This gives them the best of both worlds: the trust of residential IPs with the stability and speed of datacenter infrastructure. They are an excellent choice when you need long-lived, static IPs that look like real users but perform with the consistency of server-hosted connections.

## Why ISP Proxies?

Compared to standard Residential or Datacenter proxies:

- They are trusted like residential IPs, since they originate from ISPs.  
- They are stable and static, meaning the IP address does not change.  
- They perform at low latency and with strong reliability.  

This makes them ideal for applications that cannot afford frequent IP changes or rotations.

## How ISP Plans Work

ISP proxies are delivered as a monthly subscription plan.  

Once payment is confirmed, your proxies appear automatically in the **Dashboard → Generation → ISP & Datacenter** section.  

Unlike Residential proxies, you do not need to generate them. They are provisioned directly and remain active until the subscription period ends.  

From the Dashboard you can:

- Copy them to your clipboard.  
- Download them as a `.txt` file.  
- Monitor subscription status and renewal dates.  

## Supported Carriers

All ISP proxies come from real, reputable Internet Service Providers.  

We currently support:

- **Deutsche Telekom** **AG**
- **Glide**  
- **RCN**  
- **Virgin Media**  

By using IPs from these major carriers, our ISP proxies maintain the trust and legitimacy required for high-success-rate tasks.

## Using the Dashboard

1. Purchase an ISP subscription from the Dashboard.  

2. Navigate to **Dashboard → Generation → ISP & Datacenter**

3. Your assigned proxies will be displayed immediately.  

4. Use the **Copy** or **Download** options to export them into your workflow.  

Because they are static, your proxy list will not change unless you switch plans or renew with different resources.

## Best Use Cases

ISP proxies are best for scenarios where IP stability and trust are critical:

- E-commerce automation and account management
- Social media and platform account operations
- Long-term scraping sessions that require a fixed IP identity
- Ad verification that must appear from a consistent residential-like IP
- Workflows where both performance and legitimacy matter

## Billing and Renewal

- ISP proxies are billed monthly as a subscription.
- Proxies remain active until the subscription expires.
- Renewal keeps the same proxy pool active.

## Troubleshooting

Proxies not appearing after payment

Refresh the Dashboard; assignment can take a few seconds.

Confirm you are checking the ISP Proxies section.

If still missing, contact support with your order details.

Authentication errors

Double-check the username:password credentials.

Verify that the format matches your tool’s requirements (ip:port:user:pass or user:pass@ip:port).

If using IP Whitelisting, confirm that your current IP address is registered.

Performance issues

Test proxies individually to identify if a specific IP is slow.

Ensure your network or script is not creating excessive concurrent requests.

Contact support if you consistently experience poor performance across multiple proxies.

Subscription expired

Verify that your payment was processed successfully.

Renew your subscription to maintain the same proxies.
