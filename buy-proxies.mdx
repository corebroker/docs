This guide explains how to **purchase** proxy plans on Quantum Proxies and how to **generate** usable proxy credentials (residential, datacenter, mobile, rotating or sticky) from the Dashboard and via the API.

## Short workflow 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to the Dashboard.  ">
    You need to have an active account created.

    <Card title="Create your account" icon="person-circle-plus" color="#ffffff">
      
    </Card>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select or purchase a proxy plan.  ">
    Choose the product type: **Residential**, **Datacenter**, or **ISP**

  </Step>
  <Step title="Pay">
    Click **Buy** (or **Top Up**) and complete payment using the available payment methods.  \
    We support Stripe for card payments and Cryptomus for cryptocurrency payments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate proxies">
    Go to **Dashboard → Generation → ISP & Datacenter / Residential**

    <Accordion title="ISP & Datacenter" icon="computer-classic">
      Unlike Residential or Mobile proxies, you don’t need to manually generate ISP or Datacenter proxies.

      As soon as your payment is confirmed, your ISP/Datacenter proxies will automatically appear in the ISP/Datacenter section of your Dashboard. You can access them immediately, no extra steps required.

      From the Dashboard, you can:

      - **Download all proxies** as a `.txt` file for bulk usage.
      - **Copy proxies directly to your clipboard** for quick setup in your tools or scripts.

      ISP/Datacenter proxies are dedicated and static, so once purchased they are instantly provisioned to your account.  No configuration or generation logic is needed, you simply buy and start using them.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Residential" icon="house-blank">
      Residential proxies are IPs from real devices connected through ISPs, making them perfect for web scraping, automation, ad verification, and other use cases that require high trust and low detection rates.

      Unlike ISP or Datacenter proxies (which are provisioned automatically after purchase), Residential proxies must be generated inside the Dashboard after you’ve purchased a plan.

      Once you have an active Residential plan, you’ll see it listed under **Dashboard → Generation → Residential**.

      1. <u>Select your active plan</u>

      - All your Residential plans are shown in cards.   
      - Each card displays **remaining bandwidth** and **used bandwidth**.  
      - Click the plan you want to use for generation.  

      2. <u>Configure proxy generation</u>

      Below the plan list you’ll find the **Generate Residential Proxies** section.

      Here you can set:

      - **Country** → Choose the country you want your proxies to come from.  
      - **Format** → Select the output format (e.g., `ip:port:user:pass`).  
      - **Type** → Choose **Rotating** or **Sticky** proxies.  
        - _Rotating_: IP changes automatically on each request.  
        - _Sticky_: IP stays the same for a set duration (e.g. 5m, 30m, 1h).  
      - **Quantity** → How many proxies you want to generate in one batch.

      3. <u>Generate & copy</u>

      Once you’ve configured the settings:

      1. Click **Generate Proxy**.  
      2. Your proxies will appear in the **Proxy List** panel on the right side.  
      3. From there, you can:
         - **Copy** them directly to your clipboard.  
         - **Download** them as a `.txt` file.  

      The generated proxies will follow the format you selected, for example:

      ```text
      url:port:user_abc312:pass_xxx
      url:port:user_abc123:pass_xxx
      ```
    </Accordion>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Billing & limits

The way billing works depends on the type of proxies you purchase.  

**Residential proxies** are sold as **one-time packages** based on bandwidth. Every gigabyte of traffic you use is deducted from your package, and once it runs out, you simply purchase a new one. 

<Info>
  This makes Residential ideal for flexible or on-demand use, since you only pay for the data you actually consume. 
</Info>

**ISP and Datacenter proxies,** on the other hand, work on a **monthly subscription model**. As soon as your payment is confirmed, the proxies are delivered to you automatically and remain active for the entire subscription period. Because these proxies are static and dedicated, they do not operate with bandwidth limits in the same way as Residential proxies.

In both cases, your Dashboard keeps you informed of your remaining resources and active subscriptions, so you always know where you stand. 

<Tip>
  if your business requires higher volumes, custom plans, or SLAs, our sales team ([team@quantumproxies.net](mailto:team@quantumproxies.net)) is available to design a solution tailored to your needs.

## Troubleshooting

\*\*1. ****``403or ** 407(authentication error)``****

- Verify credentials (username/password) are correct.
- If using IP whitelist, confirm the request originates from an authorized IP.
- Ensure the proxy session type (sticky vs rotating) matches the credential type issued.

**2. No proxies returned after Generate (API)**

- Ensure your plan has sufficient allocation or balance.
- Confirm that `quantity` requested does not exceed plan limits.
- Check API key permissions (the key must allow generation actions).

**3. High latency or timeouts**

- Choose a different region or datacenter.
- Verify the product type (datacenter for lowest latency).
- Check for rate-limiting or temporary network issues.

**4. Billing / purchase not active**

- Verify Stripe or payment method status and transaction success.
- Allow a short processing window for some payment methods to clear.
- Contact support with transaction id if your plan remains inactive after payment.

## Troubleshooting
