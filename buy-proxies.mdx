This guide explains how to **purchase** proxy plans on Quantum Proxies and how to **generate** usable proxy credentials (residential, datacenter, mobile, rotating or sticky) from the Dashboard and via the API.

## Short workflow (high-level)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to the Dashboard.  ">
    You need to have an active account created.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Pay">
    Click **Buy** (or **Top Up**) and complete payment using the available payment methods.  \
    We support Stripe for card payments and Cryptomus for cryptocurrency payments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate proxies">
    Go to **Dashboard → Generation → ISP & Datacenter / Residential**  

    <Accordion title="ISP & Datacenter" icon="computer-classic">
      Unlike Residential or Mobile proxies, you don’t need to manually generate ISP or Datacenter proxies.  

      As soon as your payment is confirmed, your ISP/Datacenter proxies will automatically appear in the ISP/Datacenter section of your Dashboard. You can access them immediately, no extra steps required.  

      From the Dashboard, you can:

      - **Download all proxies** as a `.txt` file for bulk usage.  
      - **Copy proxies directly to your clipboard** for quick setup in your tools or scripts.  

      ISP/Datacenter proxies are dedicated and static, so once purchased they are instantly provisioned to your account.  No configuration or generation logic is needed, you simply buy and start using them.

## Billing & limits

- Generated proxies deduct from your plan allocation or balance immediately.
- Check **Dashboard → Usage** to monitor bandwidth, concurrent connections and remaining credits.
- Rate limits on API endpoints may apply; consult **API → Rate Limits**.
- For high-volume needs, contact sales for custom plans and SLAs.

## Troubleshooting

**1. **`403`**or ** `407`**(authentication error)** 

- Verify credentials (username/password) are correct.
- If using IP whitelist, confirm the request originates from an authorized IP.
- Ensure the proxy session type (sticky vs rotating) matches the credential type issued.

**2. No proxies returned after Generate (API)**

- Ensure your plan has sufficient allocation or balance.
- Confirm that `quantity` requested does not exceed plan limits.
- Check API key permissions (the key must allow generation actions).

**3. High latency or timeouts**

- Choose a different region or datacenter.
- Verify the product type (datacenter for lowest latency).
- Check for rate-limiting or temporary network issues.

**4. Billing / purchase not active**

- Verify Stripe or payment method status and transaction success.
- Allow a short processing window for some payment methods to clear.
- Contact support with transaction id if your plan remains inactive after payment.

## Troubleshooting
